## Core Concepts
### Reflections on the reading
  I think I lean more towards Latour & Lowe's understanding of cultural reproduction than Benjamin's. This is not to say that I disagree with Benjamin on everything; though I find his views a little overly cycnical, some of his remarks on the ways in which we passively consume media and culture can seem uncomfortably prophetic. But I disagree that reproduction necessarily makes an object transitory, and I made note of this in hypothes.is: I actually believe that our modern technology has allowed us for potentially longer-lasting preservation of some media and culture, and thus a potentially longer period period for engagement with it.
  
  Latour & Lowe's idea of the "aura" actually growing in the process of reproduction is new to me and I am quite interested in it. One instance where I can see its effects working in a somewhat odd manner is in that of the consumption of music as a cultural object. Music is currently commonly available to people in digital formats, and while little (in fact, seemingly continuously diminishing) value is placed on any given instance of recorded music such as a digital file, the abundance and easy reproduction of digital audio files seems to have given way to a fetishistic obsession with music stored in physical formats, such as vinyl. This could be seen as a kind of re-enforcing of the aura of the "physical origin" of music on vinyl record, at least in how it is seen as a cultural narrative. Whether this is an entirely appropriate use of the analysis is not totally clear to me, and I'm also prompted to wonder why a similar aura doesn't surround what was more recently the dominant physical storage device for music, the CD.
  
  As a final note, these initial readings and discussions have brought me to think a lot more about the contexts in which media is created and "performed". I am quite interested in the ways in which a particular process of making something might change in its intent as it moves from the context of the creator's original idea to the context of how that idea might be "pitched" to an audience and finally to the context in which the result is "performed" for the audience. I feel that each of these contexts has the potential to change the object of the process dramatically.

  The article seemed to make much of the possibilities of engaging with a community by not trying to digitally capture "objectively" and rather following the subjective whims of the community. I can certainly see the value in such an approach from the experiential and process perspectives, but I do wonder about its practicality. The Rhynie Woman group's concept of searching for "Art.ifacts" is certainly interesting from a theoretical standpoint. I am unsure, though, of how "accessible" their projects would be to the general public. As some of the scans/models captured did not display their objects as they would normally appear to people, they run the risk of appearing incomprensible without a guide to the goals of what the group was attempting to accomplish.

  How important this is will depend on context, of course; museums will probably be more concerned with access of display to public understanding than an art collective. And I do have to give the Rhynie Woman group credit for the defamiliarizing power of their project - perhaps a new "aura" can be bestowed on a cultural object when it becomes less recognizable in a new context?

### Reflection on lecture and discussion
  Are computers "creative"? I've actually thought about this a fair bit on my own before this class in relation to music. A few years ago, there was a lot of hype over some of the first "AI" able to "compose" music. I can't say my reactions were particularly positive at the time - I didn't really see the point. I had wondered why someone would create a machine to take over a task (the task being music) that humans already enjoy doing themselves?
  
  However, when the creativity is put to more utilitarian purposes, it's probably worth my while to revisit the concept of "computer creativity". My main worries on this topic are that people will fail to recognize that there is a process behind these "creative" programs that is, at some point, organized and led by humans, bringing their own creativity to the table. In some respects, the machines will be limited in their "creativity" by the original parameters set by the human programmers. I like the analogy in the lecture about computers being "prostheses for thought", though I also recognize that because of the processes that happen within these "creative" programs, it will be harder to determine the origin points of what they produce. This comes back to the discussion of the "blurring of the lines" on the boundaries of objects.

 ### Reflection on class discussion
  Our discussion today on ethics and accessibility in digital humanities endeavors covered a lot of topics I was quite interested in. While we considered the roles of those in digital humanities to consist, among other things, of critically analyzing the human aspects of new technologies and their social implications, one person brought up the issue of corporate ownership and access to digital materials. This is a serious issue that digital humanities scholars and graduates will have to come to terms with; I have already worried about its effects on the ways in which we consume media such as film, music and literature. We can see within libraries and academia in general how many scholarly publications are digitized and kept behind paywalls.
  
  This also, however, applies to the materials we use for making digital objects, such as what we intend to do in this course. Tools for photogrammetry have appeared on the market for free only to be suddenly kept behind paywalls when the companies realized they could make a profit from the demand - Scann3D is one such example. I can't claim to have any answers to these very serious issues in the field, but the discussion certainly got me thinking more about them.

  I feel as if perhaps the power of mash-ups is partly in what they are composed of and the challenges they pose, but also partly in their performance as "mash-ups" - that is to say, the act of designating a particular cultural performance as a "mash-up", a "genre" in its own right, is itself a challenging act. I feel like this distinction is important because on one hand, everything in culture can be retroactively deemed a mash-up if we fully reject the Platonic ideal of an original; every piece of culture borrows elements from something that came before it and re-contextualizes them. But in acknowledging this process and making it the focus of a performance, I feel that mash-ups re-contextualize their elements in a way that is, if not new, at least challenging to notions of intellectual property and originality in our current period of history.
  
  One thing I wonder about from the article (and from a lot of "critical theory"/Frankfurt School critiques of pop culture in general) is how much the mash-up supposedly undermines the importance of pop culture through its repetition and interchangeability. In fact, I'm not quite certain it accomplishes this. Some have taken mash-ups further into the past - I can recall a particular musician who noticed that a whole wide range of songs from throughout history all use the same chords that are usually attributed to the classical piece "Pachabel's Canon". This, then, seems to be less about diminishing the importance of "low culture" and more about revealing the very concept of "low culture" to be an illusion brought on by a particular historical perspective - remove the historical distance and the common elements and interchangeability reveal themselves just as fully.

  With respect to the discussion of the political uses and implications of replicas, I have already been considering the strange position of our chosen object for our project: it is not merely an object from another ancient civilization (one located in Africa, plundered by European archaeologists), it is a replica of that object that is likely meant to increase its historical aura. What are the political implications of such a replica? I find this hard to define. I think many would like to argue that it is made with a kind of "disinterested" archaeologist's eye, appreciating it as an art (and possibly ritual) object from another period in history for another culture which the curators would like the world to become educated on.
  
  I'm not quite sure, however, that this is entirely accurate. Though owning a replica of William (the nickname for the statue of the Egyptian hippo) might serve partially to bring about a certain historical aura surrounding it and inspire further education on its context, it is also ultimately a commercial object meant for profit...and the profits don't necessarily go towards the country the object was likely taken from. That being said, I don't know much about the actual circumstances in which William was acquired, and the statue may have been bought...but then it could still be seen as profiting off of licensed replicas of a historical object bought for a one-time fee.
  
  In our own project, we have a 3D model of this replica, which, while not perfect, could potentially be distributed for free again. This isn't necessarily what we aim to do with it, but it is an interesting alternative possibility that sidesteps the profit angle. Perhaps one could argue that a more ethical approach to these historical object replicas is to give them away so as to increase historical curiosity? But in what way is that history being framed? Which country's narrative is William serving? How is William being used as an example of art history and how does this play into the larger question of the historical significance of objects we may or may not understand the purposes of?

  One potential question as to the implications of museums becoming (as the reading suggested) "open doorways out into the world", collections of objects and artifacts that can be copied and thus manipulated: does this not still make the museum the primary gatekeeper that sets the boundaries of what the artifact is allowed to be? In one sense, opening up the possibilities of an object for manipulation is defining a sense of what it is allowed to be; it could potentially be expanding boundaries that the originators of the object might not have been comfortable with. This sounds like a lot of moral panic over the "cult of the original", but I wonder about some of its ethical implications for humans-as-artifacts.
  
  If that sounds odd, let's look at a recent example: the musician Prince died recently. But in the last month, there was talk of bringing up a hologram of Prince to "perform" at the Superbowl. This hologram is effectively a limited digitized version of Prince, a "perservation" of some part of his visual essence that is then manipulated to act in a new way. If a museum or other preservational institute could claim to "own" Prince as an important cultural object, this seems to be well within their rights, according to the article; it allows for a kind of "remix" of the artist, placing him in a new circumstance. One of Prince's bandmates, however, objected to this practice, and the hologram did not appear. Indeed, I think it would strike many of us as unethical - it certainly struck me so. So the unanswered question is: at what point is a remix infringing on one's human rights? If a deceased person's estate becomes a kind of "curator" of their possessions, to what extent should they allow others to manipulate the person's creations and presence-that-constituted-their-creations?

  Considering the potential to integrate games into teaching history in innovative ways, I also feel like an education in gaming analysis in general could be helpful. After all, seeing as games are such a widespread form of entertainment, those who play them may as well get educated on the unseen processes at work in whatever they might be playing. This could help people not only in understanding the ways in which gaming mechanics can be used to teach history - it could allow them to critically reflect on the games they play everyday, considering the implicit rules of the mechanics within those games. I worry that too many people play games entirely uncritically and don't reflect on what structures, behaviours and narratives they might be unconsciously internalizing from those games.
  
  This isn't just a concern about "violent video games making kids more violent" (which I don't necessarily believe); it's more to do with things like previous examples of how the mechanics of the Civilization series, while allowing for a "postmodern remix" version of history, still imply specific culturally-contingent ideas about history that players might not think twice about since they've accepted them as necessary rules of the game.

### Reflection on lecture
  I know I argued about this in class enough, but I'm still quite stuck on the idea of graphics not "mattering" in video games as they produce history. On one hand, I understand the importance of cutting to the study of game mechanics as a whole spearate medium by which to teach history...but on the other hand, I think those mechanics exist so rarely in the absolute abstract that it would be hard to deny that other media that come into contact with them (such as graphics) are still important in constructing the experience. Even in purely text-based games, there are decisions on what visual style a game is going to adopt through fonts and other aesthetic choices. I do agree that much money and time is wasted in the gaming industry over creating "realistic" graphics, but this doesn't mean graphics aren't important, simply that they shouldn't be the central focus of constructing gaming experiences.
  
  As a sort of supplementary argument to this: I base part of my arguments as to why games' graphics are important in the fact that many have claimed that a lot of games are becoming more "cinematic". If games are doing so, they are crossing over into the territory of another medium - which I think is fine! Mixed-media art can be fascinating to engage with and analyze, and I think there's a fair bit of potential in this form. However, something I am wary about is the assumption many gamers seem to make that "cinematic" games make for more "realistic" play (or that that is the goal of a more film-like approach). This is an area in which one should think very critically, both about the ways the graphics and cutscenes are designed (who designed them? with what motives? why would we consider this particular depiction of a historical person as "accurate" or "realistic"?) and about what the mechanics allow the players to do (our whole discussion about what the historical narratives woven by the rules that define these mechanics).
  
### Gaming Notes for "A Path of Honor"
-much of the opening paragraph was skipped-the player plays as the son in a Roman family

-the family played an important role in leading the state

-the player observes their given stats at the game's outset

-the player is going to try a new character out of disinterest in the initial stats

-he points out the stats are listed along the side of the text

-he skims over much of the paragraph in the opening section

-some of the words in the gameplay were unknown to the player

-the player decided to serve with the army for a year

-the player was satisfied with the role he was given in the army

-the player guesses his geographical location within the Roman Empire based on information given in the text

-the player infers the meaning of some of the Latin words that appear in the text

-the player discovers that he can click any Latin word to learn its English meaning

-the player is confronted with three options, deliberates over them but makes a decision to let some enemy soldiers go based on a drive to continue their character's life

-the player finds combat in the text-based game is based more in choices of "character" rather than on technical actions; the arms employed in battle are more narrative functions than mechanical ones

-the player finds the story is making sense so far based on the actions taken

-the player noted there was only one choice present in the campaign they played through

### Reflections On This Module Overall
  Unfortunately, I feel I have less to discuss about this particular module than any other. The article and class discussion certainly made me reconsider our portrayal of our model with regard to the "digital colonialism" problems. We continually (without thinking) referred to our object by the name given to it by the colonial archaeologists who took it from its original territory - "William". We also tended to centre our narratives about it around this colonial possession. On one hand, this might be impactful as we were trying to challenge the notion that the object is of Western "ownership" simply because it rests in a Western museum; on the other, it could potentially be seen as reducing the object to its colonial history rather than any other meaningful history it might be associated with.
  
  I found the articles and videos on augmented reality interesting...but their relevance felt a little more removed from what we were working on with our projects, since many of them involved completing tasks that were much more advanced than what we could have done with our relatively small amount of experience and time. This being said, I feel like they allowed us a vision of the potential of augmented reality if one was given more time to work with it. I wonder if in the future it might be better to split some of these readings up between discussions of these advanced projects (which reveal potential) and more basic "instructional" readings so that we could get a head-start on understanding how to better use these technologies.
