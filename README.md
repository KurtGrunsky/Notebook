### Reflection on the reading
  The article seemed to make much of the possibilities of engaging with a community by not trying to digitally capture "objectively" and rather following the subjective whims of the community. I can certainly see the value in such an approach from the experiential and process perspectives, but I do wonder about its practicality. The Rhynie Woman group's concept of searching for "Art.ifacts" is certainly interesting from a theoretical standpoint. I am unsure, though, of how "accessible" their projects would be to the general public. As some of the scans/models captured did not display their objects as they would normally appear to people, they run the risk of appearing incomprensible without a guide to the goals of what the group was attempting to accomplish.

  How important this is will depend on context, of course; museums will probably be more concerned with access of display to public understanding than an art collective. And I do have to give the Rhynie Woman group credit for the defamiliarizing power of their project - perhaps a new "aura" can be bestowed on a cultural object when it becomes less recognizable in a new context?
